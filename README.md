# Project paper work

This contains the code to the project paper regarding predictions of dynalmical systems with Graph neural networks. The experiments are done on heat diffusion and wave propagation systems.


_Heat diffusion_

Here is a heat diffusion for a longer time period with a larger graph for illustration purposes.

_Wave propagation_

Here are two wave propagations for longer time period with larger graphs for illustration purposes.
